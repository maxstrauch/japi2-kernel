> Japi is an open source free software GUI toolkit, which makes it easy to develop platform independent applications. Written in JAVA and C, Japi provides the JAVA AWT Toolkit to non object oriented Languages like C, Fortran, Pascal and even Basic.

Japi uses a Java application called **Japi kernel** which acts like a X server and displays the controls requested by the Japi C library. Therefore C programs can easily be extended by a (simple) GUI.

The original Japi kernel uses the AWT GUI library provided by Java. Since this toolkit is very old this project aimed to port the Japi kernel to the SWING GUI toolkit providing more modern GUI elements.

This repository provides the following project resources:

 - Complete source code of Japi 2 kernel. The project has been developed using NetBeans IDE 8.1. Therefore this repo can directly be opened as a project.
 - [An extensive project documentation (only in German)](/documentation.pdf?raw=true) which describes the structure of the Japi 2 kernel, design thoughts and gives a tutorial on how to implement new custom components.
 - [The main architectural model of the Japi 2 kernel (only in German)](/japi4-model.pdf?raw=true)
 - The Java Doc of this project in the subfolder `dist/javadoc/`.
 - The executable Japi 2 kernel as JAR file in [`dist/japi2.jar`](/dist/japi2.jar?raw=true).

# Usage

This project only aims on porting the Japi kernel. To get runnable examples please take a look at the Japi project page [here](https://userpages.uni-koblenz.de/~evol/japi/japi.html) and download the complete source tree. Place all files and folders of this repository in the `java` subfolder of the Japi source tree and compile it. Then the Japi 2 kernel will be compiled into the Japi library.
